# Test of the Solution Report - IoTBay Web Application

## Software Application Feature

### Feature Description: User Management System (Feature 4)

The User Management System is a comprehensive administrative feature that allows staff users to manage all user accounts within the IoTBay platform. This feature implements full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user management.

#### Functional Description:

**Core CRUD Operations:**

- **Create**: Staff can create new user accounts with roles (customer/staff), including validation for email uniqueness, password strength, and required fields
- **Read**: View user lists with search/filter capabilities, pagination, and detailed user profiles
- **Update**: Modify user information including name, email, phone, role, and active status
- **Delete**: Remove user accounts with proper authorization checks

**User Stories Mapping:**

1. **US-UM-01**: As a staff member, I want to create new user accounts so that I can onboard customers and staff members
2. **US-UM-02**: As a staff member, I want to view and search user accounts so that I can find specific users quickly
3. **US-UM-03**: As a staff member, I want to update user information so that I can maintain accurate user records
4. **US-UM-04**: As a staff member, I want to deactivate/activate user accounts so that I can manage user access
5. **US-UM-05**: As a staff member, I want to delete user accounts so that I can remove inactive or problematic users

#### Changes Since Assignment 1:

- Enhanced validation for email format and password strength
- Added user search and filtering capabilities
- Implemented pagination for better performance
- Added user status management (active/inactive)
- Improved error handling and flash messaging
- Added role-based access control with middleware

## Non-functional Aspects

### Security:

- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication with role-based access control
- **Authorization**: Only staff users can access user management features
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with salt rounds for password storage
- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation for all user inputs
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Sequelize ORM with parameterized queries

### Performance:

- **Pagination**: Implemented to handle large user datasets efficiently
- **Database Indexing**: Email field indexed for faster searches
- **Query Optimization**: Selective field retrieval excluding sensitive data

### Usability:

- **Responsive Design**: Tailwind CSS for mobile-friendly interface
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search by name and phone number
- **Flash Messages**: User feedback for all operations
- **Form Validation**: Client and server-side validation with error messages

### Reliability:

- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive try-catch blocks with graceful error recovery
- **Data Integrity**: Foreign key constraints and validation rules
- **Transaction Management**: Atomic operations for data consistency

### Changes Since Assignment 1:

- Improved error handling with better user feedback
- Enhanced security with additional validation layers
- Better performance through pagination and optimized queries
- Improved accessibility with better form labels and error messages
